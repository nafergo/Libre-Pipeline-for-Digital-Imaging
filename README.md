# Welcome!

The Libre Pipeline for CGI project is a directory with links to Free/Libre and Open Source Software and resources or assets (3D models, photos, HDRI, sounds, etc.) that you can use in CGI projects.

ABOUT THE SOFTWARE  
We only list “Free Software”. This means software that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. To avoid misconceptions (in this case, Free doesn’t mean it is gratis), this type of software is sometimes called “Libre Software”. For more information on this, please check the [Free Software Definition](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html).

ABOUT THE ASSETS  
We like the [Creative Commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/), specially CC0 and CC-BY or CC-BY-SA, but not all the listed resources use these licenses. We chose to list resources that are accessible free-of-charge (free as in gratis) and can be used for personal and commercial projects although, in some cases, some restrictions may apply.  
Nevertheless, we’re sure that you will find something useful.

Have fun!
